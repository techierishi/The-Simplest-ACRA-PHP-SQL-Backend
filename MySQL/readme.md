# MySQL

This uses the normal MySQL(which is deprecated as of PHP 5 and removed in PHP 7).

Please note that there are some aspects of this project that may be old/not updated compared with MySQLi. We do no longer update this part 
of the project due MySQL being removed in PHP 7. MySQLi is introduced in PHP 5.3 and is the only version of MySQL in PHP 7+

If possible, upgrade to PHP 7 and use [the MySQLi version](https://github.com/GamersCave/The-Simplest-ACRA-PHP-SQL-Backend/edit/master/MySQLi/) of this project
