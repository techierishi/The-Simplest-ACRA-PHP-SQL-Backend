# Requirements

Lowest PHP version supported is 5.3, PHP 7 is recommended. 

## Do I need MySQLi/MySQL to use this backend?

No you do not. Using viewfiles.php allows you to see the file names and read the files without using SQL. 

MySQL requires the MySQL version of this project. It is however no longer going to be updated, so it is recommended to use MySQLi instead

MySQL will no longer be developed either so any bugs in MySQL will never be solved.
